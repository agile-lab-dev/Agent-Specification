# Agent Descriptor Specification

This repo hosts the specification for **Agent Descriptors**. These descriptors define the attributes of different **agent components** that can be used within an **agentic system**. These components allow for modular, reusable structures that enable the agent to interact with data, execute actions, and enforce policies.

## Specification

The specification is also available as [OpenAPI 3.0 endpoints](agent-specification.yaml), to create the foundation of an **Agent Descriptor Registry**.
